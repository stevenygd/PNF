## Introduction

Neural fields have emerged as a new paradigm for representing signals, thanks to
their ability to do it compactly while being easy to optimize. In most applications,
however, neural fields are treated like a black box, which precludes many signal
manipulation tasks. In this paper, we propose a new class of neural fields called
basis-encoded polynomial neural fields (PNFs). The key advantage of a PNF is
that it can represent a signal as a composition of a number of manipulable and
interpretable components without losing the merits of neural fields representation.
We develop a general theoretical framework to analyze and design PNFs. We use
this framework to design Fourier PNFs, which match state-of-the-art performance
in signal representation tasks that use neural fields. In addition, we empirically
demonstrate that Fourier PNFs enable signal manipulation applications such as
texture transfer and scale-space interpolation. 

## Installation 

This repository provides a [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) environment, and requires NVIDIA GPU to run the
 optimization routine. 
The environment can be set-up using the following commands:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate PNF
```

## Try Fitting PNF on Camera Men!
```bash
python train.py configs/camera_PNF_FF.yaml
```
